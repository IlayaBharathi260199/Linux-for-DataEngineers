chmod
=====

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.
It allows you to specify who can read, write, or execute a file.

The numeric representation consists of three digits, each representing a different user category:

Owner (User): The first digit represents the owner of the file or directory.
Group: The second digit represents the group associated with the file or directory.
Others: The third digit represents other users who are neither the owner nor in the group.
Permissions are represented by adding the values for specific permissions:

Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1
To give read, write, and execute permissions to a directory for the owner, you can use the following calculation


So, to grant full permissions to the owner, you set the first digit to 7. The command looks like this:

* chmod 700 directory_name

Explanation:

7 for the owner grants read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions.
0 for the group and others means no permissions.
So, the owner has full control over the directory, and the group and others have no access.
